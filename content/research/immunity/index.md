title: "Genetic determinants of anti-tumor immunity"
summary: "Genetic variation in immune genes creates inter-individual differences in immune traits. We are investigating the implications of these differences for cancer risk, progression and response to therapy. By jointly analyzing matched tumor and normal genomic data, we have found that individual immune genotypes can influence the evolution of tumor genomes, shape the tumor immune microenvironment and modify response to immunotherapy treatment. These studies will ultimately guide development of precision immunotherapies."
