title: "Predicting the effects of genetic variants on biological systems"
summary: "Experimental assays to probe genetic variants at the single cell level provide new opportunities to model the effects of variants on biological processes and cellular activities. We are developing new experimental and computational approaches to investigate the context-specific consequences of genetic variation for biological systems to better understand their implications for human health."
